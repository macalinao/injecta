Chrome extension to inject JavaScript libraries into any webpage with the click of a button.

Have you ever wanted to make a request on a page through the Chrome Developer console? Maybe you wanted to scrape a table using jQuery. Maybe you wish you had access to Lodash/Underscore's powerful comprehensions. Maybe you wanted the date processing capabilities of Moment or the functional elegance of Ramda.

With Injecta, you can now do this without having to copy/paste scripts into the console. Injecta allows you to inject pre-defined JavaScript libraries directly into webpages to give you full control of your webpages.

## Usage

![screenshot][screenshot]

Click the button on the top right, select your scripts, enter desired CDN urls, then hit "Inject".
